  One-hit kills using collision detection + attack animation
  Enemies are either lab employees on the right side up, hazmat soldiers, or military
  Enemies are knocked back on death


  Enemy switches to a second “dead” sprite with a large cut
  After demo feeds, the enemy that was fed on turns into a universal skin that is a ‘blood red blob of a person’
  Demogorgon can feed on corpses to regain health
  Feeding makes the Demogorgon immobile for 2.5 seconds

  Demogorgon starts with 50 HP
  Flamethrowers: −5 HP per second
  Guns: −5 HP per shot
  Shotguns: −15 HP per shot



**AI Behavior**
  Demogorgons chase humans when you play as a human
  Humans attack Demogorgons when you play as a Demogorgon
  Humans can appear in the Upside Down when playing as the Demogorgon


**Enemies & Creatures**
